# **Codechella Hack**

**Building long-lasting communities around trending hashtags, while interacting healthily.** 
## **Inspiration:**
Twitter communities are short-lived and primarily formed around the trending hashtags. Once those hashtags are no longer trending, the communities die out and it’s difficult to stay connected with the people you once tweeted, retweeted, and had meaningful conversations with. Thus, having mental health in mind to support the users by comparison program.

## **What it does:**
When a user searches for a hashtag, they can access tweets, photos, and videos around that topic. They can also see the users who are a part of that community. Currently, the user needs to have the community name in their bio/name to be a part of that community. However, not everyone wants this information made public. Also, having the community name in their name limits them to the number of communities they can be a part of.

A new feature that Twitter recently launched is called “Moments”. Users need to create their own Moments with tweets that they like. We plan to use this feature and make it more automated. Users can be part of communities by tweeting, retweeting, and saving tweets with a particular hashtag. These communities that users choose to be a part of can be automatically added to their Moments page. They can continue to post new tweets and interact with the members even after the hashtag is no longer trending, allowing them to set the visibility of their tweets to only the members of that community.
